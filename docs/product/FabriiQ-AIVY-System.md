## AIVY System Overview

### What is AIVY?

**AIVY (Artificial Intelligence Virtual Yearning)** represents the next generation of educational AI technology - a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system that coordinates specialized AI agents to provide comprehensive educational support. Built on proven educational psychology principles and advanced AI architecture, AIVY transforms the learning experience through intelligent, context-aware interactions that maintain educational integrity while maximizing learning outcomes.
