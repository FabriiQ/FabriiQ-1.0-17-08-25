## System Overview

The Fee Management System is a comprehensive solution designed specifically for educational institutions to handle all aspects of student fee collection, from initial setup to payment processing and reporting. The system is built to accommodate institutions of all sizes, from small schools to large universities with multiple campuses.

### Key Benefits
- **Centralized Management**: All fee-related activities are managed from a single platform
- **Automated Processing**: Reduces manual work through automation of calculations and notifications
- **Flexible Configuration**: Adapts to different institutional requirements and fee structures
- **Real-time Tracking**: Provides instant visibility into fee collection status and outstanding amounts
- **Multi-campus Support**: Handles complex organizational structures with multiple campuses and programs

## Core Components

### 1. Fee Structures
Fee structures are the foundation of the system. They define what fees students need to pay for specific programs or courses.

**What it includes:**
- Tuition fees
- Laboratory fees
- Library fees
- Examination fees
- Activity fees
- Any other institutional charges

**How it works:**
- Each program or course can have its own fee structure
- Fee structures can be recurring (monthly, quarterly, annually) or one-time
- Different fee structures can apply to different academic terms or cycles

### 2. Student Enrollment Fees
When a student enrolls in a program, the system automatically assigns the appropriate fee structure to their enrollment.

**Process:**
1. Student enrolls in a program/course
2. System identifies the applicable fee structure
3. Fee is assigned to the student's account
4. Student receives notification of fee due

### 3. Payment Processing
The system handles various payment methods and tracks all transactions.

**Supported Payment Methods:**
- Cash payments at campus counter
- Bank transfers
- Online banking
- Mobile payments (JazzCash, EasyPaisa)
- Cheque payments
- Credit/Debit cards

## Fee Structure Management

### Creating Fee Structures

**Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Define Basic Information**
   - Name of the fee structure (e.g., "Computer Science Semester 1")
   - Description of what the fee covers
   - Associated program and campus

2. **Set Fee Components**
   - Break down the total fee into components
   - Example: Tuition (₨50,000), Lab Fee (₨5,000), Library Fee (₨2,000)
   - Each component can have its own description

3. **Configure Timing**
   - Set if the fee is one-time or recurring
   - For recurring fees, specify the interval (monthly, quarterly, etc.)
   - Link to specific academic cycles or terms

### Managing Fee Structures

**Editing Existing Structures:**
- Modify fee amounts (affects future assignments only)
- Add or remove fee components
- Update descriptions and timing

**Deactivating Structures:**
- Mark fee structures as inactive when no longer needed
- Existing student assignments remain unaffected
- Prevents new assignments of outdated fee structures

## Student Fee Assignment

### Automatic Assignment
When students enroll in programs, the system automatically:
- Identifies the correct fee structure for their program
- Calculates the total amount due
- Sets appropriate due dates based on institutional policies
- Creates a fee record in the student's account

### Manual Assignment
Administrators can also manually assign fees for:
- Special programs or courses
- Make-up classes or additional services
- Custom fee arrangements for specific students

### Fee Calculations
The system calculates the final amount by:
1. Starting with the base fee structure amount
2. Applying any applicable discounts
3. Adding any additional charges
4. Including any outstanding arrears from previous terms
5. Generating the final payable amount

## Payment Processing

### Recording Payments

**For Cash Payments:**
1. Student pays at campus counter
2. Staff member logs into the system
3. Finds the student's fee record
4. Records the payment with receipt number
5. System automatically updates the student's balance

**For Bank Transfers:**
1. Student makes bank transfer
2. Staff receives bank statement
3. Payment is recorded with transaction reference
4. System matches payment to student account

**For Online Payments:**

**1. Fixed Amount**
- Simple flat fee for late payments
- Example: ₨500 late fee regardless of amount owed

**2. Percentage-Based**

- Example: 2% of the overdue amount

**3. Daily Charges**
- Fee increases each day payment is late
- Can be fixed daily amount or daily percentage
